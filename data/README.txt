Unusual success, future uncertainty, and science needs for adaptive management of invasive plants in a US national park


This repository contains the data used in this manuscript. Below are descriptions for the two data files.


---

**IPM_species_data.csv**
Yearly totals for hours of effort and amount of herbicide used on nine species/genera of invasive plants from 1998 to 2022. Hours of work were not recorded in 1988.

Species - six-letter code for each of the nine invasive plants
ScientificName - full scientific name for each taxon
Year - year ranging from 1988-2022
Hours - number of hours (converted to decimal number) spent actively managing each plant
Herbicide (oz) - total amount of herbicide (in ounces) used


---

**IPM_summary_data.csv**
Yearly summary of total invasive plant management action across all species from 1988-2022. Hours of work were not recorded in 1988.

Year - year ranging from 1988-2022
SpeciesManaged - number of total different species/taxa managed
Sites - number of sites where there was active invasive plant management
Hours - number of hours (converted to decimal number) spent actively managing all invasive plants
Herbicide (oz) - total amount of herbicide (in ounces) used across all invasive plants


Missing data code: NA
