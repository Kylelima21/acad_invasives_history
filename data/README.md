<br>

This repository contains the data used in this manuscript. Below are descriptions for the two data files.


---

**IPM_species_data.csv** <br>
Yearly totals for hours of effort and amount of herbicide used on nine species/genera of invasive plants from 1998 to 2022. Hours of work were not recorded in 1988. <br>

Species - six-letter code for each of the nine invasive plants <br>
ScientificName - full scientific name for each taxon <br>
Year - year ranging from 1988-2022 <br>
Hours - number of hours (converted to decimal number) spent actively managing each plant <br>
Herbicide (oz) - total amount of herbicide (in ounces) used <br>

**IPM_summary_data.csv** <br>
Yearly summary of total invasive plant management action across all species from 1988-2022. Hours of work were not recorded in 1988. <br>

Year - year ranging from 1988-2022 <br>
SpeciesManaged - number of total different species/taxa managed <br>
Sites - number of sites where there was active invasive plant management <br>
Hours - number of hours (converted to decimal number) spent actively managing all invasive plants <br>
Herbicide (oz) - total amount of herbicide (in ounces) used across all invasive plants <br>
